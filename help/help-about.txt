Direct Code V3.0 
Author: Mike Yaunish

Direct Code has been built on the foundation of livecode-enhanced, which was
written by Nenad Rakocevic and Didier Cadieu.

This project has been inspired by the work and observations of Bret Victor. 
I hope Direct Code can make the process of programming more playful, experimental and 
inventive.
