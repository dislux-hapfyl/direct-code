Direct Code V1.4
Author: Mike Yaunish

This project has been inspired by the work and observations of Bret Victor. 

This is more than just a programming curiousity. I believe that this kind of direct interaction 
with our programming efforts can lead to a whole new way of thinking and creating. Also
I think this is an inevitable progression of modern programming.

Any environment devoid of easy experimentation and play is missing a whole spectrum of creative 
expression and invention.
